<p><strong>Description</strong> - <br />
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo">Vertigo</a> is a sensation that everything around you is spinning
    or moving, which is usually caused by a problem in the inner ear, but can also be caused by vision problems. People
    with vertigo commonly feel things are moving when they are standing completely still and everything around them is
    still. Vertigo is more severe than dizziness. People with vertigo may find it harder to move around because the
    spinning sensation tends to affect balance.</p>
