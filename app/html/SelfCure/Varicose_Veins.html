<p><strong>Description</strong> -
    If you have noticed blue or purplish protruding veins running down your legs you probably suffer from varicose
    veins. The condition is a lot more prevalent among older individuals, and is unlikely to affect teenagers or young
    adults. Women are also a lot more susceptible to varicose veins, especially during pregnancy, pre-menstruation and
    menopause. Men are more likely to suffer from testicular varicose veins, which is one of the leading causes of male
    infertility.
