    <strong>Description</strong> - <br />
    Mouth ulcers are open sores, which appear in the mouth. They are white or yellow in color, and are normally
    accompanied with a sharp pain, which is felt most when the person is eating. The pain is quite sharp when salty or
    spicy food passes over the ulcer. Mouth ulcers can occur wherever in the mouth - on the inner surface of the
    cheeks, lips, tongue, palate and at the base of the gums
