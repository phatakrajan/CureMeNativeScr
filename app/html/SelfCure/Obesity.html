<p><strong>Description</strong> - <br />
    Obesity is a physical condition that occurs from excessive storage of fat in the body. Obesity has been defined as
    a weight more than 20% above what is measured usual as per the body mass index, which is calculated from an
    individual's age, height, and weight. Excess of fatty tissues results in obesity and causes fitness disorders. One
    of the places where the excessive body fat can easily be seen is around the waistline. A waist measurement of 40-45
    inches or more in men and 35 inches or more in women is linked to an amplified risk for heart disease and other
    health problems associated with obesity.
