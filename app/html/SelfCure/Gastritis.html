<p><strong>Description</strong> -<br />
    Gastritis is an inflammation, irritation, or erosion of the lining of the stomach. The inflammatory lesions may be
    either acute (suddenly) or chronic (gradually). Gastritis is actually the medical term for almost any stomach
    upset, sometimes also referred to as gastroenteritis. If gastritis is left untreated, it can lead to a severe loss
    in blood, or in some cases increase the risk of developing stomach cancer.

        <li>Stay away from foods that upset your stomach, especially spicy or deep fried foods</li>

        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_gruel">Rice gruel</a> is an excellent remedy for acute cases of
            gastritis. One cup of rice gruel is recommended two times daily.</li>
        <li>Potato juice has been found important in relieving gastritis. The suggested dose is half a cup of the
            juice, two or three times daily, half an hour before meals.</li>
        <li>Curds and cottage cheese should be used generously. Too many dissimilar foods should not be mixed at the
            same meal. Meals must be taken at least two hours before going to sleep at night.</li>
        <li>The patient should ban the use of alcohol, tobacco, spices and condiments, meat, red pepper, sour foods,
            pickles, strong tea and coffee. He must avoid sweets, pastries, rich cakes, and aerated waters.</li>
        <li>Application of heat with a hot compress or hot water bottle, two times daily, either on an empty stomach or
            two hours after meals, will also be useful.</li>
        <li>The patient may assume a fast for two of three days or more, depending on the severity of the condition. He
            must be given only warm water to drink during this period. This will give rest to the stomach and allow the
            toxic situation causing the inflammation to subside.</li>
        <li>After the acute signs subside, the patient must adopt an all-fruit diet for the next three days and take
            juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, grapefruit, oranges, pineapple, peaches, and melons.</li>
