<p><strong>Description</strong> - <br />
    Gas/Flatulence is the emission of a mixture of gases called 'flatus' present in the intestine. This gas is produced
    by symbiotic bacteria and yeasts found in the gastrointestinal tract. Flatus is usually released under pressure
    through the anus which creates sound and is often accompanied by a foul odor.</p>
