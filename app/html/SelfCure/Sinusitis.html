<p><strong>Description</strong> - <br />
    Sinusitis refers to an inflammation of the mucus membrane lining the para-nasal sinuses. It often follows a common
    cold, influenza, and other general infections. Infecting germs sometimes find their way into sinuses or chambers on
    either side of the nasal passage, leading to sinus trouble. The sinuses are basically moist air passages that are
    hollowed out in the facial bones, behind and around the nasal area
