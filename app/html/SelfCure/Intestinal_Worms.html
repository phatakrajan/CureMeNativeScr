<p><strong>Description</strong> - <br />
    Worms are a common problem for humans across the world and can affect any of us irrespective of age or gender,
    but the problem is most prevalent among toddlers and children. Worm infestations can in most cases be treated
    quite easily and effectively with medicated intestinal worms treatments. Worm infestations may not always pose
    a serious direct risk, but they can cause some serious complications if neglected that may even be life
    threatening. This is why the problem of parasitic worms should always be treated very seriously.

    <strong>Symptoms</strong>:-

    <ul>
        <li>The usual symptoms of intestinal worms are diarrhea, foul breath, dark circles under the eyes, constant
            desire for food, restlessness at night with bad dreams and headaches.</li>
        <li>Worms may give rise to inflammation of the intestine and lungs, nausea, vomiting, loss of weight, fever,
            nervousness, and irritability.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Causes</strong> -
    <ul>
        <li>Eating contaminated food.</li>
        <li>Worms may enter the body from dirty fingers and food.</li>
        <li>Worms may enter the human body through bare foot walking on infected earth.</li>
        <li>Worms may be transmitted to the body through undercooked flesh foods or foods contaminated by dogs.</li>
        <li>The real cause of intestinal worms, however, is faulty living. The eggs of these worms, taken into the
            human body through food, and water, can breed in the intestines only if they find there a suitable medium
            for their propagation. This medium is an intestinal tract clogged with morbid matter.</li>

    <strong>Self Help</strong> -
    <ul>
        <li>A tablespoon of freshly ground coconut should be taken at breakfast, followed by 30 to 60 ml of castor oil
            mixed with 250 to 375 ml of lukewarm milk after three hours. This process may be repeated till the cure is
            complete.</li>
        <li>Worms in children can be eradicated by taking onion juice.</li>
        <li>Both fresh garlic and its oil are effective. An ancient method of its administration was to place a couple
            of cloves fresh garlic in each shoe. As the person walked, the cloves got crushed, and the worm-killing
            garlic oil was absorbed by the skin and carried by the blood into the intestines easily, as it possessed a
            powerful penetrative force. This ancient method is worth a trial by those who do no not like the taste of
            garlic and cannot eat it. Those who can eat raw garlic, however, should chew three cloves of garlic every
            morning.</li>
        <li>Take 4 tablespoonful of the fresh milky juice of unripe papaya fruit with 1 tablespoonful of honey and 4
            tablespoonful of boiling water. After two hours a reasonable amount of castor oil with lime juice should be
            taken.</li>
        <li>A small cup of grated carrot taken every morning, with no other food added to the meal, can clear these
            worms quickly.</li>
    </ul>
