<p><strong>Description</strong> -
    A common cold is rightly termed so because of the multiple kinds of colds that an individual goes through in
    his/her lifetime. Common colds are often a very mild viral infection that clears up after it has run its course. In
    isolated incidents, common colds can increase in severity and may lead to advanced infections like bronchitis or
    pneumonia. </p>

        <li>People who have a chronic medical condition are also susceptible to colds as their immune system is quite
            compromised
        </li>
        <li>Low strength, exposure to cold, lack of sleep, mental depression, fatigue, and factors such as sudden
            modifications in temperature, dust and other irritating inhalations are important contributory causes</li>
