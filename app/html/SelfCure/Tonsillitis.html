<p><strong>Description</strong> -
    Tonsillitis refers to acute inflammation of the tonsils, which lie, one on each side of the throat. The tonsils are
    part of the immune system and protect against germs by producing antibodies. These antibodies play an important
    role in the body’s immune system by attacking bacteria and viruses. However, during this process of protecting the
    body, the tonsils may also become inflamed or infected.
