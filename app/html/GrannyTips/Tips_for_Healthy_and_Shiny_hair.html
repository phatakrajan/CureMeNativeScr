<p>Granny recommends following tips - </p>
<ul>
    <li>It is better to apply castor oil for a healthy growth of hair.</li>
    <li>Wash hair with tea once in a week.</li>
    <li>Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besan">besan</a> in the hair and wash it with water drained from the
        cooked rice.</li>
    <li>Soak a handful of gooseberries in a cup of milk for two hours. Make a paste and apply on the hair.</li>
    <li>Apply the mixture of an egg white, 2 spoons of castor oil, 1 spoon glycerin, in the scalp and hair. Wash it after
        some time.</li>
    <li>Massage hair with warm coconut oil an hour before washing. Let it soak. Cover your head with a hot towel and wash
        your hair after an hour or so.</li>
    <li>Boil a few hibiscus flowers in coconut oil. Filter and use this hair oil to control hair loss and thinning.</li>
    <li>Do a 'steam-towel-wrap' once in a while, if your cuticles are damaged, as this steaming opens out the pores and absorbs
        the oil.</li>
    <li>Soak 1 teaspoon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek">fenugreek</a> in curd and keep it for a night.
        Apply it in the next morning.</li>
    <li>Boil coconut oil with the juices of curry leaves, basil, hibiscus flower and gooseberry. Apply on hair, keep it for
        sometime and rinse.</li>
    <li>Daily application of coconut oil mixed with lime- juice on the hair is also beneficial. Applying juice of green coriander
        leaves on the head is also good.</li>
    <li>Washing the hair with a paste of cooked Urad dal (black beans) and fenugreek (methi) 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li>Take some coconut and mustard oil. Soak half a cup of curry leaves in the oil mixture and keep it for a night. Next
        morning, heat on a slow flame till the curry leaves turn crisp. Remove from heat and add two to three camphor balls.
        Allow oil to cool and then strain. Apply oil to hair roots using cotton wool along the parting and massage in circular
        movements. Leave the oil overnight and shampoo the next morning. Repeat twice a week.</li>
    <li>Rub the scalp vigorously after washing the hair. It increases the blood circulation, and activates the sebaceous
        glands.</li>
    <li>A mixture of lettuce and spinach juice is good to drink to induce hair growth. The juice of alfalfa mixed with that
        of carrot, and lettuce juice is also good to take.</li>
