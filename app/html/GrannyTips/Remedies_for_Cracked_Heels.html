<p>Granny Says:-I know that can hurt but there is a cure for that. Follow simple tips given below and see it for yourself.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Soak your feet in warm water with liberal amounts of baby oil. Pat dry and surround them in plastic wrap so that
        they stay moist.</li>
    <li>Try immersing feet in warm water and honey for 15 minutes. Honey works wonders for treating cracked feet.</li>
    <li>Make your own foot lotion by combining baby lotion with spearmint and eucalyptus oil. Massage into feet and cover
        them in thin cotton socks. Sleep in your lotion-rich socks and then rinse carefully in the morning (your feet may
        be slippery!).</li>
    <li>Scrub your feet every morning with a homemade foot scrub made from 4 tablespoons of salt mixed with Â½ cup of baby
        oil, almond oil, or coconut oil.</li>
    <li>Douse feet in petroleum jelly and cover them with clean, soft socks. Dab petroleum jelly on the cracks throughout
        the day.</li>
    <li>Soak the feet in lemon juice for about 10 minutes. Follow this therapy on a weekly basis until one finds a change.</li>
    <li>A regular application of a mixture of glycerin and rosewater is known to soothe and cure cracked heels.</li>
