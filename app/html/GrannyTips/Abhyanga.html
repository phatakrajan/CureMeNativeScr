    Though Abhyanga is described in Diwali in Indian calendar, it should be done every day during winter and at least once in
    a week in other seasons.
</p>
<p>
    Sesame oil should be used during winter because of its higher oil content. While Coconut oil is ideal for seasons other than
    winter.

    So treat yourself with Abhyanga not only in Diwali but regularly.</p>
