<ul>
    <li>Potato juice has bleaching agents in it, so you can take potato juice out and apply it on your skin. You can soak
        cotton balls in the juice and can keep them on your eyes for at least 20 minutes while having rest.</li>
    <li>Grated cucumber juice is very useful for dark circles. You can apply it on the eyes the same way you apply potato
        juice.</li>
    <li>Keep 2 cucumber slices on your eyes.</li>
    <li>Tea water too reduces the puffiness and dark circles of the eyes and rejuvenates the eyes by refreshing them. You
        can boil tea in water and restrain the leaves. You can refrigerate this water in the freezer to make ice cubes. Keep
        these ice cubes on the eyes in a cotton cloth for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Take a teaspoonful of milk powder and add honey to it. Put this paste on the skin on the dark circles. It helps in
        reducing the dark circles.</li>
